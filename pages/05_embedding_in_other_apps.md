## Embedding into Salesforce Lightning

Much of this playbook focuses on embedding Tableau content in custom-developed web applications, but there is also support for a common embedding scenario with Salesforce.

Tableau provides a free Salesforce Lightning web component that facilitates embedding scenarios withing the Salesforce ecosystem.

* For information about the Tableau View and Tableau Pulse Lightning web components, see the [Tableau Lightning Web Components](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/lwc_seamless_auth.htm) documentation.
