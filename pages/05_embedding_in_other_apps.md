## Embedding into Salesforce Lightning

Much of this playbook focuses on embedding Tableau content in custom-developed web applications, but there is also support for a common embedding scenario with Salesforce.

Tableau provides a free Salesforce Lightning web component that facilitates embedding scenarios within the Salesforce ecosystem.

* For information about the Tableau View and Tableau Pulse Lightning web components, see the [Tableau Lightning Web Components](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/lwc_seamless_auth.htm) documentation.
* Tableau LWC components can also be customized; see the [Tableau Insights Delivered Directly to Salesforce with Dynamic Data Security](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/07/tableau-insights-delivered-directly-to-salesforce-with-dynamic-data-security) blog post for details and an example.
